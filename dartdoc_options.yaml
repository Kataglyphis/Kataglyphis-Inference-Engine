# “additional-docs” tells Dartdoc: “Here are extra markdown files to render
#  as top-level pages in the generated doc site.” Each entry is a path
#  (relative to the project root).
additional-docs:
  - docs/INTRODUCTION.md
  - docs/USAGE.md
  - docs/TUTORIAL.md

# You can also group them under a logical “folder” name in the nav:
# navigation:
#   - name: "Guides"
#     children:
#       - docs/INTRODUCTION.md
#       - docs/USAGE.md
#       - docs/TUTORIAL.md
